# CPP-DS-AI-Mini-Coding-Python-Competition
#Created on 11/7/2023 by Kevin Wong
These are a small compilation of Python scripts that were created at Cal Poly Pomona's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Clubs's Python Team Challenge.
At this challenge, all club members joined to create teams of 4, tested our Python knowledge, and learned together as we competed against our peers.
